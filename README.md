# Number Guessing Game

Number Guessing Game is a simple number guessing game inspired by a drinking game. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to practice building a simple web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Live Site

This project is now hosted on Netlify. You can view the live site at [https://number-guess-game-rsp0225.netlify.app/](https://number-guess-game-rsp0225.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to create the Number Guessing Game:

- HTML: The structure and layout of the webpage were created using HTML.
- CSS: The styling of the webpage was implemented using CSS.
- JavaScript: JavaScript is used to provide the game logic and to make the game interactive
- Bootstrap: The layout, styling, and responsive design of the webpage were created using Bootstrap.

## Features
Users enter a number between 1 to 100 and users have a total of five chances to guess the correct number. 
The game provides hints and reactive UI that adjusts its display for the user based on the entered number:

- If the number entered by the user is less than the number selected by the computer, the game notifies the user with "Up!".
- If the number entered by the user is greater than the number selected by the computer, the game notifies the user with "Down!".
- If the number entered by the user matches the number selected by the computer, the game notifies the user with "That's right!" and the game ends.

The "Go" button is deactivated when the game is over. The "Reset" button can be pressed at any time to reset the game.

A wmessage appears when a user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 100 or when the user enters a value that has already been entered. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser like Google Chrome.

## Usage
To play the game, open the index.html file in your web browser of choice. Enter your numbers in the input box and click the "Go" button to get hints on whether your guess was higher or lower than the computer's selection.

If you want to reset the game, click the "Reset" button. The game automatically deactivates the "Go" button after using all five chances.
